## Quick Start

This container contains OpenVPN and Transmission with a configuration
where Transmission is running only when OpenVPN has an active tunnel.
It bundles configuration files for many popular VPN providers to make the setup easier.

```
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -d \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/data \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
              -e CREATE_TUN_DEVICE=true \
              -e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA \
              -e OPENVPN_CONFIG=CA\ Toronto \
              -e OPENVPN_USERNAME=user \
              -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=pass \
              -e WEBPROXY_ENABLED=false \
              -e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16 \
              --log-driver json-file \
              --log-opt max-size=10m \
              -p 9091:9091 \

## Please help out (about:maintenance)
This image was created for my own use, but sharing is caring, so it had to be open source.
It has now gotten quite popular, and that's great! But keeping it up to date, providing support, fixes
and new features takes a lot of time.

I'm therefore kindly asking you to donate if you feel like you're getting a good tool
and you're able to spare some dollars to keep it functioning as it should. There's a couple of ways to do it:

Become a patron, supporting the project with a small monthly amount.

$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --device=/dev/net/tun -d \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/data \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
              -e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA \
              -e OPENVPN_CONFIG=CA\ Toronto \
              -e OPENVPN_USERNAME=user \
              -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=pass \
              -e WEBPROXY_ENABLED=false \
              -e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16 \
              --log-driver json-file \

```

You must set the environment variables `OPENVPN_PROVIDER`, `OPENVPN_USERNAME` and `OPENVPN_PASSWORD` to provide basic connection details. 

The `OPENVPN_CONFIG` is an optional variable. If no config 
is given, a default config will be selected for the provider you have chosen. Find available OpenVPN configurations by looking in the openvpn folder of the GitHub repository. The value that you 
should use here is the filename of your chosen openvpn configuration *without* the .ovpn file extension. For example: 

``` 
-e "OPENVPN_CONFIG=ipvanish-AT-Vienna-vie-c02"
```

You can also provide a comma separated list of openvpn configuration filenames. If you provide a list, a file will be randomly chosen in the list, this is useful for redundancy setups. For example: 

```
-e "OPENVPN_CONFIG=ipvanish-AT-Vienna-vie-c02,ipvanish-FR-Paris-par-a01,ipvanish-DE-Frankfurt-fra-a01"
```

### Supported providers
This is a list of providers that are bundled within the image. Feel free to create an issue if your provider is not on the list, but keep in mind that some providers generate config files per user. 
This means that your login credentials are part of the config an can therefore not be bundled. In this case you can use the custom provider setup described later in this readme. The custom provider 
setting can be used with any provider.
